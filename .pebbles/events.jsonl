{"type":"create","timestamp":"2026-02-18T20:02:41.417533Z","issue_id":"lcmtui-e5b","payload":{"description":"## Overview\n\nTwo related UX improvements to make lcm-tui self-sufficient for LCM operations without needing to query the database directly.\n\n## 1. Surface IDs Throughout the UI\n\nCurrently the LCM conversation_id (e.g. 642) and summary IDs (e.g. sum_52d9dd2ff6735eff) are internal DB values not shown anywhere in the TUI. Users need to query SQLite directly to use CLI tools like dissolve.\n\n**Changes needed:**\n- Show `conv_id: NNN` in the conversation list and/or conversation header/detail view\n- Show summary IDs in the Summary DAG view (each node should display its ID)\n- Make IDs copyable or at least visible for reference\n\n## 2. Interactive Dissolve in DAG View\n\nThe dissolve command (dissolve.go) already exists as a CLI subcommand. Wire it into the Bubble Tea DAG view as an interactive operation.\n\n**UX flow:**\n1. User navigates to a condensed summary node in the DAG view\n2. Press `d` to initiate dissolve\n3. Show confirmation screen with dry-run info:\n   - List of parent summaries that would be restored\n   - Token impact (current tokens → restored tokens, delta)\n   - Number of ordinal shifts required\n4. `y` to confirm and execute, `n` or Esc to cancel\n5. After execution, refresh the DAG view to show updated state\n\n**Implementation notes:**\n- dissolve.go already has the core logic (DissolveSummary function with dry-run support)\n- Need a confirmation modal/overlay in Bubble Tea\n- DAG view refresh after mutation\n- Consider showing a brief success/failure message after execution\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Conversation IDs visible in conversation list/detail\n- Summary IDs visible on each node in the DAG view\n- Press `d` on a condensed node in DAG view triggers dissolve flow\n- Confirmation screen shows dry-run preview before executing\n- DAG view refreshes after successful dissolve","priority":"1","title":"Show conversation/summary IDs in TUI + interactive dissolve in DAG view","type":"feature"}}
